# neural-networks-class

The fully connected feed-forward neural network I created in my Neural Networks class, built from scratch and implemented with arrays. 

Back propagation has been implemented for any number of hidden layers.

Sample configuration files are a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt. 
Corresponding sample output files are loga.txt, logb.txt, logc.txt, and logd.txt.
